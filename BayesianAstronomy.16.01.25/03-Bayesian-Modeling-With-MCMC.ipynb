    "\n",

    "In $N$ dimensions, we have $100^N$ evaluations, and as $N$ grows this quickly becomes untenable! For example, if we have only six model parameters, this \"dense grid\" approach will require evaluating the posterior at one trillion grid points, the results of which would require several terabytes of memory just to store!\n",

    "### The Metropolis-Hastings Sampler\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the simplest of MCMC samplers is the *Metropolis-Hastings Sampler*.\n",
    "This provides a procedure which, given a pseudo-random number generator, selects a chain of points which (in the long-term limit) will be a representative sample from the posterior. The procedure is surprisingly simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a posterior $p(\\theta~|~D, I)$\n",
    "2. Define a *proposal density* $p(\\theta_{i + 1}~|~\\theta_i)$, which must be a symmetric function, but otherwise is unconstrained (a Gaussian is the usual choice).\n",
    "3. Choose a starting point $\\theta_0$\n",
    "4. Repeat the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. Given $\\theta_i$, draw a new $\\theta_{i + 1}$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   2. Compute the *acceptance ratio*\n",
    "      $$\n",
    "      a = \\frac{p(\\theta_{i + 1}~|~D,I)}{p(\\theta_i~|~D,I)}\n",
    "      $$\n",
    "   \n",
    "   3. If $a \\ge 1$, the proposal is more likely: accept the draw and add $\\theta_{i + 1}$ to the chain.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   4. If $a < 1$, then accept the point with probability $a$: this can be done by drawing a uniform random number $r$ and checking if $a < r$. If the point is accepted, add $\\theta_{i + 1}$ to the chain. If not, then add $\\theta_i$ to the chain *again*.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few caveats to be aware of when using MCMC\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. The procedure is provably correct... but only in the long-term limit!\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes the long-term limit is **very** long. What we're looking for is \"stabilization\" of the MCMC chain, meaning that it has reached a statistical equilibrium. There is a vast literature on how to measure stabilization of an MCMC chain. Here we'll use the sloppy but intuitive LAI approach (i.e. Look At It).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. The size of the proposal distribution is *very* important\n",
    "\n",
    "- If your proposal distribution is too small, it will take too long for your chain to move, and you have the danger of getting stuck in a local maximum for a long (but not infinite) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If your proposal distribution is too large, you will not be able to efficiently explore the space around a particular peak\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, choosing an appropriate scale for the proposal distribution is one of the most difficult parts of using the MCMC procedure above.\n",
    "More sophisticated methods (such as what we will use below) have built-in ways to estimate this along the way, but it's still something to be aware of!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Fast Stabilization can be helped by good initialization\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, assuring that MCMC will stabilize quickly has a lot to do with choosing a suitable initialization. For this purpose, it can be useful to find the maximum a posteriori (MAP) value, and initialize the chain with this."
